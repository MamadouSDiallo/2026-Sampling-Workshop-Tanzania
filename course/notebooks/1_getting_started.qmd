# Why Use R?

R is one of the most powerful and accessible tools for statistical analysis and data visualization. It stands out for several key reasons:

- **Free and open source** — R is freely available for everyone, with an active global community continually improving it.  
- **Built for data and statistics** — Unlike general-purpose programming languages, R was designed by statisticians for statistical computing and data analysis.  
- **Extensive ecosystem** — Thousands of contributed packages extend R’s capabilities to nearly every area of analytics, from survey sampling and causal inference to machine learning.  
- **Strong community support** — You’ll find abundant learning resources, user forums, and continuous academic and industry contributions.  

> **In short:** R empowers you to handle, analyze, and visualize data efficiently — and it’s here to stay.

# A Brief History of R

R has its roots in a long tradition of statistical programming languages:

- **1980s:** The *S language* was developed at AT&T Bell Labs to make data analysis more accessible.  
- **1995:** *R* was created by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** at the University of Auckland, modeling many of S’s concepts but built as open source.  
- **1997–present:** The *R Core Team* — an international group of volunteer developers — maintains and evolves the language.  
- **2003:** The **R Foundation for Statistical Computing** was established to support and guide R’s development and community.

Today, R is one of the world’s most widely used languages for statistics, data science, and research.

# Course Overview

This introductory session provides a foundation for data analysis using R.  

By the end, you will be able to install R and RStudio, write basic code, and understand how R organizes data and functions.

**Course outline:**

1. **Basics of R** — syntax, objects, and working environment  
2. **The Tidyverse** — using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `readr` for clean and consistent data workflows  
3. **Data Visualization with ggplot2** — building clear, publication-quality graphics  
4. **Introduction to Data Analysis and Survey Sampling** — understanding core statistical reasoning and complex sample designs

# Setting Up Your Environment

Before getting started, you’ll need to install both **R** (the language) and **RStudio** (the integrated development environment).

### Step 1. Install R

Download and install R for your operating system:

🔗 [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### Step 2. Install RStudio

RStudio provides an intuitive interface for writing and running R code:

🔗 [https://posit.co/download/rstudio/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio/)

### Step 3. Verify Installation

After installing both, open **RStudio** and type:

```{r}
version

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```
