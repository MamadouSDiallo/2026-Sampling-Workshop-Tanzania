`s‍vy` is a Python package for designing and analyzing **complex survey data**.

Large-scale surveys are often selected using complex random mechanisms such as
**stratification**, **clustering**, or **unequal probabilities**. To produce accurate
estimates, statistical analyses must account for the sampling design.
`s‍vy` provides a unified toolkit for working with these designs, ensuring that
inferences correctly reflect the underlying population.

`svy` provides a comprehensive set of tools to support quantitative survey research.
